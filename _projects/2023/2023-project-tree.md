  As one of the core developers. We proposed a confidence-guided roadside tree extraction algorithm. The core idea is to first segment pole-like objects and calculate their confidence of being trees, then classify these pole-like targets into trees and non-trees. Next, we use a combination of weighted distance constraints and an allometric model to extract individual trees using the optimized minimum cut method. Based on the extraction results of individual trees, we estimate tree parameters and ultimately obtain 3D tree models through 3D modeling techniques.
