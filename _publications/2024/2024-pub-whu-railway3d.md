  This paper introduces WHU-Railway3D, a diverse point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS) dataset specifically tailored for railway scenes. Spanning approximately 30 km and comprising 4.6 billion points, the dataset includes 11 richly annotated categories across urban, rural, and plateau railway environments.
